Your task is to generate a Python function to process an anomalies dataset.

The function should:

Accept an anomalies dataset in CSV format as input.
Apply pre-defined validation rules directly derived from a list of instructions in a file named sample-inst.txt.
The col-desc.txt file contains descriptions for each field present in the anomalies dataset and is provided for a functional understanding, but should not directly influence the function code.

Requirements:

The function should be well-documented with docstrings explaining the purpose and logic of each step.
The validation rules should be pre-coded within the function based on the information provided in sample-inst.txt.
The validation rules once applied on the provided anomalies dataset. And each record once processed, should be updated with all the validation message(s).
validation message should include the reason for violation of validation of columns
Example validation message:
1. HedgedRisk is 5 which is not in [1,2,3,4]

Please generate the Python function according to the guidelines above.
do not give any comments. I want only code.
The generated function should work even when the data has missing values, or empty strings.
Below are the details of the input files:
Instructions file: sample-inst.txt

ASU2017-12HedgeDesignations – Use "1" for Last-of-Layer, "2" for Selected Contractual Cash Flows, or "3" for Not Applicable.


Column descriptions file: col-desc.txt
IdentifierType: The type of identifier for the security. Example: CUSIP, ISIN.
IdentifierValue: The unique value identifying the security. Example: 123456789 (CUSIP), US1234567890 (ISIN).
AmortizedCost_USDEquivalent: The amortized cost of the hedged security in USD. Example: 25,000,000.
MarketValue_USDEquivalent: The market value of the security in USD. Example: 26,500,000.
AccountingIntent: The classification of the security—Available-for-Sale (AFS), Held-to-Maturity (HTM), or Equity (EQ). Example: AFS.
TypeOfHedge: Specifies whether the hedge is for fair value or cash flow. Example: 1 (Fair Value Hedge).
HedgedRisk: The specific risk being hedged, such as interest rate or credit risk. Example: 2 (Interest Rate Risk).
HedgeInterestRate: The benchmark interest rate for hedging interest rate risk. Example: 1 (US Treasury Security Interest Rate).
HedgePercentage: The portion of the asset being hedged, expressed as a decimal. Example: 0.75 (75%).
HedgeHorizon: The remaining timeline of the hedge effectiveness or covered transactions. Example: 2027-12-31.
HedgedCashFlow: Indicates the type of cash flow, e.g., principal, interest, or both. Example: 1 (Principal and Interest Cash Flows).
Sidedness: Whether the hedging instrument offsets risk one-sidedly. Example: 1 (One-sided).
HedgingInstrumentAtFairValue: The USD-equivalent fair value of the hedging instrument. Example: -5,000,000.
EffectivePortionOfCumulativeGainsAndLosses: The USD gain/loss related to the hedge. Example: -300,000.
ASU2017-12HedgeDesignations: Designations under ASU 2017-12, such as "Last-of-Layer." Example: 1 (Last-of-Layer).
