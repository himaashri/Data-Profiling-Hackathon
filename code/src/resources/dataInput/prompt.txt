You are a python expert. 
Your task is to generate a Python function to process an anomalies dataset.

The function should:

1. Accept an anomalies dataset in CSV format as input.
2. Apply pre-defined validation rules directly derived from a list of instructions in a file named sample-inst.txt.
3. The col-desc.txt file contains descriptions for each field present in the anomalies dataset and is provided for a functional understanding, but should not directly influence the function code.

Requirements:

1. The function should be well-documented with docstrings explaining the purpose and logic of each step.
2. The validation rules should be pre-coded within the function based on the information provided in sample-inst.txt.
3. The validation rules once applied on the provided anomalies dataset. And each record once processed, should be updated with all the validation message(s).
4. Validation message should include the reason for violation of validation of columns.
5. The function should handle missing values and ensure that the data types are correctly validated.
6. If a value is missing or invalid, the validation message should indicate this.
7. If a date value does not follow the specified format (yyyy-mm-dd), it should be considered a validation violation.
8. Name of the generate function should be process_anomalies_dataset

Example validation message:
1. HedgedRisk is 5 which is not in [1,2,3,4]
2. HedgedCashFlow is missing

Please generate the Python function according to the guidelines above.
Do not give any comments. I want only code.
The generated function should work even when the data has missing values, or empty strings.
Below are the details of the input files:
